      <p>
        MusicGen is a personal project by Abdullah Chaudary, designed to explore the creative boundaries of interactive music generation. Inspired by a passion for blending technology and art, MusicGen empowers users to create unique musical experiences through various mediumsâ€”whether it's using your camera to shape sounds, experimenting with a theremin, or diving deep into synths with full MIDI support.
        <br>This project showcases the seamless integration of cutting-edge web technologies like VueJS, Three.js, and Tone.js to create an accessible yet powerful music tool for both casual creators and seasoned musicians. Every feature has been designed with customization and interactivity in mind, providing an experience that is as visually captivating as it is sonically engaging.
